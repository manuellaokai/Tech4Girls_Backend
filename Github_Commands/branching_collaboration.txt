Branching in Git is used to perform operations on a branch that has been specified. When you run this command, Git will remove all files and folders from the Working Directory it is tracking (files that Git tracks are stored in the repository, so nothing is lost) and pull all of the files and directories from the commit that the branch links to from the repository. Branching helps in collaborating on projects for teams to make changes in the code review, experimentation and others.
